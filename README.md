About project
I would like to demonstrate you an open-source REST API server example from Dmitrii Bormotov by the idea that newcomers in IT industry would use it get hands-on experience with this technology (creating collections in tools like Postman and setting up test automation frameworks).

It's an example of payment system - you can log in as an admin and create users and transactions for these users. Also you can make some minor changes in server configuration. For more information about routes, it'd better to open Postman collection (which is included in current repo).

No database needed.

Project setup
Rename .env.example file into .env. Edit data in this file if you want to (admin credentials, server port and et cetera).
Run npm i command to install dependencies from package.json file.
Run npm start shortcut command to start an API server.
